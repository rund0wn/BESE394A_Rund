Does focusing on single cells within the context of multiomic
data provide a complete picture of biological processes,
or are there important aspects that this approach might
miss?
How might the future of multiomic single-cell technology
contribute to our understanding of complex biological
phenomena?

1. *Why transcriptomics is used as cornerstone to the different multiome technologies?*

Transcriptomics is used as a cornerstone in multiomic technologies because it provides comprehensive insights into gene expression profiles, revealing how genes are actively being transcribed into RNA within cells. This information is crucial for understanding the functional elements of the genome and how they interact with each other and the environment, offering a dynamic view of cellular processes.

3. Focusing on single cells within the context of multiomic data offers unparalleled resolution of cellular heterogeneity and the specific roles individual cells play in complex biological systems. However, this approach might miss the broader context of tissue architecture and cell-to-cell interactions, which are vital for understanding the full complexity of biological processes and how cells function together in their natural environment.

4. The future of multiomic single-cell technology is poised to dramatically enhance our understanding of complex biological phenomena by integrating diverse data types (such as genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data) at the single-cell level. This integrated approach will enable a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving health and disease, potentially leading to breakthroughs in personalized medicine, disease diagnostics, and targeted therapies.
